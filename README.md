# Linear Regression for Ecommerce Platform Analysis

This project analyzes customer data from an ecommerce company to determine whether to focus on improving the mobile app experience or the website. Using linear regression, we explore relationships between customer behavior (time spent on the app/website) and total sales. The insights from this analysis will guide strategic decision-making for enhancing customer engagement and boosting revenue.
